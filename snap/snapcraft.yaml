summary: Component Pascal Collection version of IDE BlackBox Component Builder
description: |
  The WinAPI-based legacy-friendly version of BlackBox Component Builder, compatible with a lot of
  extensions from Helmut Zinn's Component Pascal Collection.
  BlackBox is open-source IDE and a framework (collection of modules)
  written in the programming language Component Pascal which is a descendant of languages
  Oberon←Modula-2←Pascal developed by Niklaus Wirth.
  BlackBox provides facilities for document creation,
  program compilation, module execution, and interface design. Component Pascal is module
  based. Each module is a unit of compilation and a unit of execution. There is no explicit
  linker. Modules are brought into memory when specified. There is no need for "header"
  files. Symbol files are automatically generated by the compiler for those elements of a
  module that are specifically marked to be exported.
  The component classes (e.g. for text or form components) follow the principle of black box
  inheritance (interface inheritance instead of implementation inheritance), hence the name
  "BlackBox".
  The compiler is very fast. The language is strongly typed. Data structures are automatically
  garbage collected when no longer referenced. The framework comes with a complete set of
  documents explaining the meaning and use of each module.
  Note: to view BlackBox documents in the terminal, recommended to use odcread.
